.SH NAME

.PP
hca
is research software 
that does various versions of non\-parametric topic models using Gibbs sampling including LDA, HDP\-LDA, NP\-LDA, NG\-LDA all with/without burstiness modelling. Various diagnostics, ``document completion\&'' testing and coherence measurements with PMI are also supported. The code 
runs on multi\-core getting about 50% efficiency with 8 cores. 
Be warned, however, that it is research code. 
Not all combinations of options behave as expected, not all 
errors behave gracefully.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.PP
hca
[\fB\-?\fP]

.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION

hca
reads the collection of files with stem 
\fIDataStem\fP
that form the input set of data. 
When checkpointing, or at termination, the output is written 
to files with stem \fIRepStem\fP\&.
On restart with the \fB\-r\fP\fI0\fP
option, some of these 
are also read initially to restore the previous state. 
A log of the run is reported to stderr
if the 
\fB\-e\fP
option is used. By default, the log goes to 
RepStem.log\&.
.PP
The programme runs a Gibbs sampler for a variety of 
non\-parametric topic models 
including simple HDP\-LDA. 
The model selected has three parts: 
.TP
alpha: 
this is the prior on topic vector (theta) for each document. 
LDA has a simple symmetric Dirichlet with parameter alpha 
and the vector has dimension T (the number of topics). 
.TP
beta: 
this is the prior on word vector (phi) for each topic. 
LDA has a simple symmetric Dirichlet with parameter beta 
and the vector has dimension W (the number of words). 
.TP
burst: 
this is the burstiness component which has 
a document specific variant of the word vector for 
each topic. This is not used by default. 
.PP
These parts are set using the 
\fB\-S\fP,
\fB\-A\fP
and \fB\-B\fP
options. 
.PP
There are various model parameters, notably the 
discount and concentrations for the different Pitman\-Yor 
processes in the model. 
These are usually sampled using Adaptive Rejection Sampling. 
They are also kept bounded using constraints hard\-coded 
into the util/dimdir.h
header file. 
So when a parameter fails to change, check the sampling 
by increasing verbosity and you may observe the value tries to 
change but doesn\&'t. 
.PP
The programme uses generalised second order Stirling numbers 
with the library extracted from libstb
version 1.8 
released at \fBhttps://github.com/wbuntine/libstb\fP\&.
This is (annoyingly) initialised with predefined bounds on the tables, 
and these can be modified with the \fB\-N\fP
option. 
This should be used for collections with larger numbers of 
documents, but its best to run first and on 
error, increase the bounds. 
See the \fIErrors\fP
for details. 
.PP
.SS CAVEAT EMPTOR
The programme is research software, so not all options 
or combinations of options work correctly. 
Note that in this release, all the poorly tested experimental features 
have been stripped, so this release contains 
only moderately well tested components. 
However, different combinations of options are not thoroughly 
tested. Documentation, itself, may also be out of date in some 
places (unfortunately). 
.PP
Note also, this is not intended to be code that others could easily 
modify. In order to get performance, to provide all the features, 
and to run multi\-core, the code is quite convoluted. 
Researchers seeking simple code they can experiment and 
modify themselves should request a cutdown version from the author. 
The safest thing is to work with the examples given at the 
end of the document. 
.PP

.SS SETTING UP THE MODEL AND HYPERPARAMETERS
For these, theta
is a vector for each document representing the 
topic proportions and 
phi
is a vector for each topic representing the 
word proportions. The task of the system is to estimate these. 
The vector theta and its various priors and parameters is the Alpha side 
and the vector phi and its various priors and parameters is the Beta side. 
All the scalar parameters can be set using the 
\fB\-S\fP\fIvar=value\fP
option 
and thereafter fixed using the \fB\-F\fP\fIvar\fP
option 
or by default sampled 
using adaptive rejection sampling. 
.PP
.TP
{\-A}{value[,file 
}] Use a symmetric Dirichlet prior on theta 
using this value
(a float/real) for each dimension. The value must be a positive float. With the optional file
argument, the file 
specifies the probability vector to use as the mean vector of the 
Dirichlet. The file is in text format representing T
(the number of topics) floats, which will be normalised. 
Then multiply the mean vector by T*value
to get the Dirichlet parameter vector. 
\fIi.e.\fP,
the mean of the T
values 
in the Dirichlet parameter vector is value\&.
.TP
{\-A}{dir[,file 
}] Same as \fB\-A\fP\fIvalue[,file]\fP
but 
value
is set to a default, 
0.05*avelen/T
where 
avelen
is the average document length in the training set. 
.TP
{\-A}{type[,file 
}] This other version of the 
\fB\-A\fP
option changes the Alpha side 
Dirichlet on theta to a Pitman\-Yor process, thus 
allowing estimation of hierarchical prior. 
It defines a distribution on theta and its prior mean (a vector) 
alpha
of type
as follows: 
.RS
.TP
hdp 
theta is modelled with a Dirichlet Process 
with mean alpha
and concentration b,
and alpha is modelled with a symmetric Dirichlet with concentration 
b0\&.
If the file
optional argument is used 
then it specifies an input file giving the 
mean of the Dirichlet over alpha\&.
By default the mean is a uniform vector. 
.TP
hpdd 
theta is modelled with a Pitman\-Yor Process 
with mean alpha,
discount a
and concentration b,
and alpha is modelled with a (truncated) GEM 
with discount a0
and concentration b0\&.
This is the default. 
The file
optional argument is ignored. 
.TP
pdp 
theta is modelled with a Pitman\-Yor Process 
with mean alpha,
discount a
and concentration b,
and the alpha vector is uniform. 
This is not hierarchical because alpha is constant. 
If the file
optional argument is used 
then it specifies alpha\&.
.RE
.RS
.PP
.RE
.TP
{\-A}{ng} 
The instigates the \fInormalised Gamma\fP
prior on theta. 
Each topic now has its own independent gamma distribution, 
Gamma(NGalpha,NGbeta),
and these are normalised to get the topic probabilities. There are 2*T
parameters now, the vector of alpha parameters for each topic and the 
vector of beta parameters for each topic. 
This means each dimension has its own independent variance parameter, 
so both mean and variance are fit per dimension. 
By default these are sampled in batches 
during standard hyper\-parameter sampling. 
Do not use with burstiness as this has not been evaluated. 
.TP
{\-B}{value[,file 
}] Use a symmetric Dirichlet prior with 
this value
for each dimension. 
The value must be a positive float. 
When this mode is running, an extra latent variable is 
sampled per document, which is saved as RepStem.UN
when checkpointing. 
\fIWarning:\fP
the value stored internally and printed is the total of this over the 
number of words W\&.
With the optional file
argument, the file 
specifies the probability vector to use as the mean vector of the 
Dirichlet. The file is in text format representing W
(the number of words) floats. 
Then multiply the mean vector by W*value
to get the Dirichlet parameter vector. 
i.e, the mean of the W
values 
in the Dirichlet parameter vector is value\&.
.TP
{\-B}{dir[,file 
}] Same as \fB\-B\fP\fIvalue[,file]\fP
but 
value
is set to a default, currently 0.001 
(10 times the current minimum allowed for a Dirichlet). 
.TP
{\-B}{type[,file 
}] 
The other form of the \fB\-B\fP
option 
similar to the \fB\-A\fP
option. 
Use a prior beta of type
``hdp\&'' ``hpdd\&'' or ``pdp\&''\&. Similar to the \fB\-A\fP
option. 
.RS
.TP
hdp 
phi is modelled with a Dirichlet Process 
with mean beta
and concentration bw
and 
beta is modelled with a Dirichlet with concentration bw0
by default symmetric (a uniform mean) 
or its mean can be set with the file
optional argument above. 
Setting file
to the reserved word ``data\&'' 
uses the observed word frequencies as the mean. 
.TP
hpdd 
phi is modelled with a Pitman\-Yor Process 
with mean beta,
discount aw
and concentration bw,
and beta
is modelled with a (truncated) GEM 
and discount aw0
and concentration bw0\&.
This is the default. 
.TP
pdp 
phi is modelled with a Pitman\-Yor Process 
with mean beta,
discount aw
and concentration bw,
and beta is by default uniform, 
or its mean can be set with the file
optional argument above. 
Setting file
to the reserved word ``data\&'' 
uses the observed word frequencies as the mean. 
This is not hierarchical because beta is constant.

.SS CONTROLLING SAMPLING OF HYPERPARAMETERS
Most hyperparameters are fit with adaptive rejection sampling (ARS) by default. 
The discount parameter of a Pitman\-Yor process, when set to zero is 
not fit, as it is assumed you want a Dirichlet process instead. 
Options give which cycles to run ARS on which hyperparameters 
and which hyperparameters not to sample. 
.RE

start
cycles and then repeat every cycles
cycles.

where 
it takes the value \fBalpha\fP,
\fBbeta\fP
or one of the 
arguments to the \fB\-S\fP
option. 
.TP
\fB\-g\fP\fIvar,batch\fP
 The vector hyperparameters bdk,
NGalpha
and NGbeta
are sampled in batches using a heuristic 
batch size. Set the batch size with

or similar, though note they all share the same batchsize. 
.TP
\fB\-G\fP\fIvar,cycles,start\fP
 Sample the variable var
where 
it takes the value \fBalpha\fP,
\fBbeta\fP
or one of the

integers are used as for 
the \fB\-D\fP
option. 
.PP
.SS GENERAL CONTROL
.TP
\fB\-c\fP\fIcycles\fP
 Do a checkpoint every this many cycles\&.
This saves the output statistics and the parameter file 
adequate to do a restart with \fB\-r\fP\fI0\fP
option. 
.TP
\fB\-C\fP\fIcycles\fP
 Stop after this many cycles\&.
Default is 100. 
Note \fB\-C\fP\fI0\fP
should be used when one just wants reports, 
as the various output files (other than reports) will be left unaltered. 
.TP
\fB\-d\fP\fIdots\fP
 For really big batches of data, print a 
``.\&'' every dots
documents within a single cycle. 
.TP

the type format\&.
Data is expected to come from 
an input file with name DataStem.Suff
where 
Suff
is an appropriate suffix.

 Quit early when total training time exceeds this many seconds. 
.TP
\fB\-N\fP\fImaxN,maxT\fP
 Set maximum for the Stirling number tables 
to count maxN
and table count maxT\&.
Default is 10000,1000. 
On collections with more than 20k documents, can require more. 
.TP
\fB\-q\fP\fIthreads\fP
 If compiled with threading, enables 
this many threads. Default is 1. 
.TP
\fB\-r\fP\fI0\fP
 Restart with all data. Currently must use the offset
equal to ``0\&'' 
for a normal restart. 
.TP
\fB\-r\fP\fIphi\fP
 Another version of the \fB\-r\fP
option 
using the string ``phi\&'' as the argument. 
Restart but now fix the word by topic matrix 
to the previously estimated values saved at 
RepStem.phi,
and the beta side is held constant and not sampled. 
Can significantly speed up testing or querying sometimes. 
.TP
\fB\-r\fP\fItheta\fP
 Second version of the \fB\-r\fP
option 
using the string ``phi\&'' as the argument.

 Do a run\-time estimation of the diagnostic Diag
starting after the start
cycle and then taking the

.TP
alpha 
Estimate the prior topic probability vector. 
Stored in the RepStem.alpha
file. 
Note useable with the 
\fB\-A\fP\fIpdp\fP
option on restart 
as the RepStem.alpha

will need to be set. 
.TP
phi 
Estimate the word probability vector for each topic. 
Stored in the RepStem.phi
file. 
If the model is not a symmetric Dirichlet model, 
then the word prior vector will be estimated and 
saved in the RepStem.beta
file 
as well. 
Note useable with the

option on restart 
as the RepStem.beta
will be read, 
though aw

.TP
prog 
How often to do the standard diagnostic reports 
(default is every 5\-th cycle). 
.TP
sparse 
Estimate topic sparsity in the theta matrix for the 
words given in DataStem.smap\&.
If DataStem.smap
is not there then this defaults to all words. 
Note, the default can be quite wasteful for multicore, is it duplicates the theta matrix 
for each thread, so only do for small data sets. 
Results placed in RepStem.smap\&.
The report gives ``topic/weight\&'' for topics including the word. 
.TP

Estimate the topic probability vector for each test document. 
Stored in the RepStem.testprob

\fB\-O\fP
 Report log likelihood, not log perplexity. Both 
are done in base 2. 
.TP
\fB\-p\fP
 Report topic coherency in the log file, 
and save the detail (per topic) in the RepStem.toppmi
file. 
This requires 
a DataStem.pmi
or DataStem.pmi.gz
file exist 
in the right format. This can be created with the 
mkmat.pl
and 
cooc2pmi.pl
scripts in the scripts directory of the release. 
The format is a simple sparse matrix form with lines 
of the form ``N M PMI\&'' for word indices 
(offset by 0) N and M and PMI value. 
\fIWARNING:\fP
the file DataStem.pmi
needs to be specifically built for 
the dataset as the word indices must align. 
By default, PMI computed for top 10 words. 
Give option twice, and PMI will be done for all top words 
ranked (as per the \fB\-o\fP
option). 
.TP
\fB\-P\fP\fIsecs\fP
 Calculate test perplexity (using document completion) 
every interval in secs
seconds. If Gibbs cycles are long, 
will report only after the cycle finishes. 
.TP
\fB\-Q\fP\fInres,file\fP

results for each. Must use the \fB\-r\fP\fIphi\fP
option with 
a pre\-estimated phi matrix (for efficiency). 
.TP
\fB\-t\fP\fIsize\fP
 Specify size of training set. It takes the 
first size
entries in the data set. Default is all the 
set minus the test data. 
.TP
\fB\-T\fP\fIfilestem\fP
 Specify a separate test set. 
Assumes the same suffix as for DataStem\&.
When using this, be sure to fix the training set size with 
\fB\-t\fP\fIsize\fP
if you do not want to train on the full 
data set. 
.TP
\fB\-T\fP\fIsize\fP
 Specify size of test set. It takes the 
size
entries immediately following the training set. 
Default is zero. This option can be confused with the above, so do not use 
filestems that are just integers. 
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
 load the dictionary from the 
DataStem.tokens
file for use in reporting. It has one token per line. 
Must have at least level two verbosity or this is ignored.

the Beta side of the model is non\-parametric. 
.TP
RepStem.UN
 latent ``mass\&'' variable kept 
for each document when the \fB\-A\fP\fIng\fP
option is used. 
.TP
RepStem.zt
 With no burstiness, gives topic 
index (offset by 0), one per line. 
With burstiness, gives one ``z,r\&'' per line where ``z\&'' is the 
topic index (offset by 0) and ``r\&'' is the burst table indicator, 
which is 1 if the word 
contributes to standard topic model statistics, and 
0 if burstiness modelling says the word is a burst 
so does not contribute to topic model statistics. 
.PP
These files along with RepStem.par
are input 
on a restart using \fB\-r\fP\fI0\fP\&.

.SH THE PARAMETER FILE

.PP
The parameter file has the following \fIdimensions\fP:
.TP
{N} \-\- number of words in the full collection, 
summed over all documents. 
.TP
{NT} \-\- number of words in the training set, 
summed over all training documents. 
.TP
{W} \-\- number of words in the dictionary. 
.TP
{D} \-\- number of documents in total. 
.TP
{TRAIN} \-\- number of documents to train on, is always the 
the first ones in the file. 
.TP
{TEST} \-\- number of documents to test on, is always the 
the last ones in the file. 
.TP
{T} \-\- maximum number of topics. 
.TP
{ITER} \-\- number of major cycles made last. 
.PP
In addition, the float parameters allowed to be specified with the 
\fB\-F\fP
and \fB\-G\fP
options are also given. 
Finally, the type of model for alpha as specified by the 
\fB\-A\fP
option is coded in the 
PYalpha
variable. 
It is 0 if the model is a Dirichlet, 
the LDA default. 
It is 1 for hdp, 2 for hpdd and 3 for pdp. 
Likewise for the PYbeta
variable and the \fB\-B\fP
option. 
.PP
If the \fB\-A\fP\fIng\fP
option is used then vectores 
NGalpha
and NGbeta
are saved as well.

.SS BASIC RUNNING
.PP
These examples work as is on late model Linux, Macs and Windows. 
However, you need to replace the executable, 
hca,
by the system dependent one, 
from the install directory where the data/
directory is. 
For instance, on Windows that might be hca/hca.exe\&.
.PP
Run basic LDA with default parameters 
and full parameter fitting on the full dataset and no testing, 
sending logging to stderr\&.
.Vb
   hca \-v \-e \-K20 \-Adir \-Bdir \-C100 data/ch c1
.Ve
Alternatively, 
run basic HDP\-LDA with parameter fitting on the full dataset and no testing, 
sending logging to stderr\&.
.Vb
   hca \-v \-e \-K20 \-B0.001 \-C100 data/ch c1
.Ve
The command lines mean: 
.TP
``\-v\&'': 
use level one verbosity; 
.TP
``\-e\&'': 
send the log file to stderr,
not to ``c1.log\&''; 
.TP
``\-K20\&'': 
use 20 topics 
(the truncation level if using \fB\-A\fP\fIhpdd\fP));
.TP
``\-Adir\&'': 
use a symmetric Dirichlet prior on topic probability 
vectors for documents with default value; 
.TP
``\-Bdir\&'': 
use a symmetric Dirichlet prior on word probability 
vectors (i.e., topics) with default value; 
.TP
``\-B0.001\&'': 
use a symmetric Dirichlet prior on word probability 
vectors (i.e., topics) with this value; 
.TP
``\-C100\&'': 
run for 100 cycles; 
.TP
``data/ch\&'': 
stem for data file; 
.TP
``c1\&'': 
stem for results file. 
.PP
Consider the HDP\-LDA version. 
Before the runtime logging starts, initial details are printed: 
.Vb
Version 0.5, H.Pitman\-Yor sampler for topics, Dirichlet sampler for words
Sampling pars: b(3), b0(3), betatot(4),
Setting seed = 1403582987
Read from ldac file: D=395, W=4258, N=84010
S\-table 'a, ad,  all zero PYP': a=0.000000, N=812/1000, M=100/1000, +S+U/V float mem=626k
mem   = 1.3 (MByte)
seed  = 1403582987
N     = 84010
W     = 4258
D     = 395
TRAIN   = 395
TEST    = 0
T     = 20
ITER  = 100
PYbeta  = 0
betatot  = 4.258000 # total over W=4258 words
PYalpha  = 2
a     = 0.000000
b     = 10.000000
a0     = 0.000000
b0     = 10.000000
Initialised with 20 classes
.Ve
Note the following: 
.TP
.B *
the betatot
value is the total of the input 
beta
(0.001) over the W=4258 words; 
internally the betatot
is maintained and subsequently 
sampled; 
.TP
.B *
the ``Sampling pars:\&'' line indicates 
hyperparameters being sampled, which are 
b,
b0,
betatot,
with 
b
and b0
being sampled every 3 major cycles and betatot
every 4 major cycles; 
.TP
.B *
in this case a
and a0
are not sampled because they are fixed at 0, 
meaning the alpha side is modelled with a Dirichlet process; 
.TP
.B *
the memory allocated is approximately 1.3Mb, 
actual usage will vary with stack memory and some items not recorded; 
.TP
.B *
the seed for the random number generator is 1403582987 
so use ``\-s1403582987\&'' to repeat the same sampling; 
.TP
.B *
there are 395 documents, 4258 different words/tokens in the dictionary and 
a total of 84010 words/tokens in the documents; 
.TP
.B *
PYbeta=0
means the beta side is a Dirichlet; 
.TP
.B *
PYalpha=2
means the alpha side is a truncated GEM prior at the top 
level and Pitman\-Yor process or Dirichlet process at the document level; 
.TP
.B *
and TEST=0
means there is no test data. 
.PP
.SS DIFFERENT MODELS
.PP
The list below gives different models that one might run. 
Note all hyperparameters will subsequently be fit during sampling, 
unless you use the \fB\-F\fP
option to switch individual fitting 
off. 
.TP
{\-Adir} {\-Bdir} : 
this is standard LDA using the default settings 
for symmetric Dirichlet priors. 
Replace the word ``dir\&'' with a float to get specific values 
initialised. 
.TP
{\-B0.001} : 
this is HDP\-LDA using a Dirichlet prior for phi 
(word probability vector), 
and a default non\-parametric prior (HPDD) for 
theta (topic probability vector). 
.TP
default:
 default is full non\-parametric topic modelling \fIwithout\fP
burstiness, 
we call NP\-LDA, 
both priors for theta and phi use the 
default non\-parametric prior (HPDD). 
.TP
{\-Ang} : 
this uses a normalised Gamma for the 
prior for theta, which means different dimensions 
have both mean and variance fit, 
we call NG\-LDA. 
Phi has the 
default non\-parametric prior (HPDD). 
.TP
{\-Sbdk=100} : 
full non\-parametric topic modelling \fIwith burstiness\fP,
bursty NP\-LDA, 
both priors for theta and phi use the 
default non\-parametric prior (HPDD). 
.PP
.SS DIAGNOSTIC REPORTS
.PP
By default, every 5 cycles, a short report is printed: 
.Vb
[26/05/2014:10:01:38] cycles:  81 82 83 84 85
log_2(perp)=11.5182,9.9503
Pars:  b=2.041296, b0=3.007822, betatot=301.019289
.Ve
The report frequency is modified with the \fB\-l\fP\fIprob,...\fP
option, and the report can be extended by adding verbosity with 
\fB\-v\fP\&.
The entry in square brackets is the system clock time 
at the start of cycle 81. 
Here cycles 81\-85 are run. 
The two perplexities reported are normalised per token and then given in 
log to base 2. The first is from the posterior probability with all 
real\-valued probability vectors marginalised out using Pitman\-Yor process 
theory but with the latent counts 
(counts of tables, not full table configurations) included. 
The second is the running total of word probabilities encountered 
during sampling. This does not include the probability cost of latent 
variables (for instance, the topics) so always less. 
After Pars:
appears the list of hyperparameters being sampled and their 
current values. 
.PP
Adding an extra level of verbosity using an additional \fB\-v\fP,
one gets 
a brief one line report for every hyperparameter being sampled, 
such as 
.Vb
  myarmsMH(b) = 3.272891<\-3.432078, w 37 calls 
.Ve
This means the adaptive rejection sampler took 37 calls 
to sample b\&.
The initial value was 3.432078 
and the final value was 3.272891. 
This line will be printed every time a sampling is done, sometimes multiple 
ones per major Gibbs cycle. 
Moreover, topic probabilities are printed. 
These are estimated (with standard smoothing) from 
training data. For instance, 
.Vb
probs =  0.041541 0.062400 0.083437 0.060447 0.025652 0.069235 ....
conc. = 10.225621, empty = 0, exp.ent = 19.049888
.Ve
The three diagnostics give additional details about the probabilities. 
The concentration (inverse of variance) applies to these, 
and it is computed differently depending on the model. 
If some topics have no data in them, empty
will tell how much. 
The effective number of topics is 19.049888, 
which is the exponential of the entropy of the probability vector 
(ignoring empty topics). 
It should always be less than the truncation level. 
.PP
At the end, a final report is printed. 
.Vb

conc. = 1.784346, empty = 0, exp.ent = 15.296125
log_2(train perp) = 11.456566
.Ve
The figures give 0.19380 seconds per cycle for the Gibbs sampler 
and 0.01307 seconds per cycle for the adative rejection sampling 
of hyperparameters. Note these figures are not collected 
correctly for the multi\-core version. 
.PP
Some basic details for the topics are given too. 
With verbosity level of 1 only diagnostics are given for topics. 
With higher verbosity word indices or words are reported as well, 
as ranked using the \fB\-o\fP
option. 
The topics are listed in terms of decreasing proportion. 
So ``Topic 6/0\&'' means ``topic number 6, which is the most frequent\&'' 
and ``Topic 14/2\&'' means ``topic number 14, which is the 3rd most frequent.\&'' 
.PP
Details of the diagnostics are as follows: 
.TP
co: 
coherence as per Mimno, Wallach, Talley, Leenders and McCallum, EMNLP 2011. 
.TP
da: 
documents with proportion for topic greater than 1/sqrt(T). 
.TP
ds: 
document sparsity, proportion of documents having zero occurrences of this topic; 
.TP
ed: 
effective number of documents, expenential of the entropy of the document distribution (the document by topic matrix normally 
normalised over topics; renormalise by documents for a given topic); 
.TP
ew: 
effective number of words, exponential of the entropy of the word distribution for topic; 
.TP
ewp: 
effective number of words, inverse of the expected word probability, Mallet\&'s alternative to ew;
.TP
ng: 
with the \fBA\fP\fIng\fP
option, gives the expected topic probability computed by normalising the means of the topic gammas, 
and a measure of overdispersion given by 
the standard\-deviation divided by the mean. 
.TP
p: 
proportion of tokens tagged with this topic; 
.TP
pd: 
Hellinger distance to the (training) population word distribution; 
.TP
t1: 
documents with this topic as most common. 
.TP
ud: 
Hellinger distance to the uniform distribution. 
.TP
ws: 
word sparsity, proportion of words occurring zero times with this topic; 
.PP
So the first topic has 6/0 given. This means it was index 6 in the 
run but is rank 0 in terms of proportion. In the saved data file 
it will be topic 6. With more verbosity, top topic words will be given 
as well ranked according to the \fI\-o\fP
option. 
Totals for some of the topics are also given: 
``Average topicXword sparsity\&'' is the mean of the word sparsities 
(ws),
``Average docXtopic sparsity\&'' 
gives the mean of the document sparsities (ds),
and the number of underused topics is the 
percentage of topics whose observed proportion 
is less than 1/T/100 or with less than 5 occurrences. 
.PP
The log_2(train perp)
figure is equivalent 
to the log_2(perp)
figure 
above because there is no test data. 
At this point, a number of data files will have been 
written, the same as done with any checkpoint. 
The main one is the parameter file 
c1.par
which gives all the dimensions as well 
as the final values of the hyper\-parameters. 
Note the probs
are also included, but these 
are for information only. 
The others can be used to restart the run. 
.PP
If you have the multicore version compiled, 
and you have an 8\-core CPU, then run with 8 threads: 
.Vb
   hca \-v \-e \-K20 \-B0.001 \-C100 \-q8 data/ch c1
.Ve
.TP
``\-q8\&'': 
use 8 threads for Gibbs sampling. 
.PP
This just repeats the above but should be faster! 
.PP
.SS RESTART AND PRINT WORDS FOR THE TOPICS
.PP
Restart from checkpoint after the previous run but run no cycles. 
Input the tokens from 
data/ch.tokens,
and print top 10 words for each topic. 
.Vb
   hca \-v \-v \-r0 \-e \-V \-C0 data/ch c1
.Ve
The new command line options mean: 
.TP
``\-v \-v\&'': 
use level two verbosity; 
.TP
``\-r0\&'': 
restart from document 0, i.e., on all documents; 
.TP
``\-V\&'': 
input the tokens from 
``data/ch.tokens,\&'' and print top 10 words for each topic. 
Note must have at least level two verbosity; 
.TP
``\-C0\&'': 
do not run any cycles, just do reporting. 
.PP
After printing initial details, this will print two 
sets of details. 
The first is a list of top topic words (if verbosity is greater than 1) 
and topic diagnostics. 
The topic diagnostics were explained in the precious subsection. 
Topics are printed in decreasing order of occurrence. 
The extra verbosity level and the \fB\-V\fP
means that topic words will be printed out too. 
.PP
Here are some sample topic lists with just ``\fB\-v\fP
\fB\-v\fP\&'',
which uses word ranking ``\fB\-o\fP\fIidf\fP\&''
by default: 
.Vb

RepStem.topcor
file, use: 
.Vb
   hca \-v \-v \-r0 \-e \-V \-V \-oidf,100 \-C0 data/ch c1
.Ve
The command line means: 
.TP
``\-V \-V\&'': 
extra \fB\-V\fP
means create the 
RepStem.topset
file of details. 
.TP
``\-oidf,100\&'': 
means report on up to 100 words for each topic, 
and words ranked by the idf
score. 
.PP
The first two lines give brief column heads for the topic and word lines. 
The scores match those printed with diagnostics. 
.PP
.SS PRODUCE SPARSITY MAPPINGS AND DOCUMENT TOPIC PROBABILITIES
.PP
Restart again and build a topic probability vector for each document, 
as well as sparsity mappings for the words in 
data/ch.smap
file. 
This you need to create/edit ahead of time. 
This must run a number of cycles because the estimates are done 
during the Gibbs sampling. 
.Vb
hca \-v \-r0 \-e \-lsparse,2,1 \-ltheta,2,1,0.001 \-C20 data/ch c1
.Ve
.TP
``\-lsparse,2,1\&'': 
sample for sparsity every 2nd cycle 
starting at the 1st. 
.TP
``\-ltheta,2,1,0.001\&'': 
sample probabilities per document 
(theta) every 2nd cycle 
starting at the 1st. 
Only report probabilities above 0.001. 
.TP
``\-C20\&'': 
sampling done for 20 cycles. 
.PP
Now view the sparsity report at c1.smap
and 
the topic probabilities at c1.theta,
and the values saved in the parameter file c1.par\&.
Again, add the \fB\-q\fP\fI8\fP
option to run this faster, 
with 8 threads (if you have 8 cores). 
.PP
Read lines in the sparsity report, c1.smap,
as follows: 
.Vb
\-\-(12): 5/2.6 14/1.3 19/219.0 perp=1.149816
.Ve
Token with index 12 occurs in topics 5, 14 and 19. 
It has 2.6 counts (its a sample average so counts can be a fraction) 
in topic 5 and 219.0 in topic 19. 
The effective number of topics using this token is 1.149816. 
This is measured as the exponential of the entropy of the topic distribution 
(i.e., probability of topic given the single word and assuming topics 
are equally likely). 
.PP
Read lines in the topic probabilities report, c1.theta,
as follows: 
.Vb
15: 16:0.006699 17:0.088948 19:0.902410
.Ve
Document 15 has 0.006699 for topic 15 and 0.902410 for topic 17. 
The three topics only add to 0.998057 because some 
smaller topics must have been dropped. 
.PP
.SS RUN WITH TESTING
.PP
Testing discussed here only tests on the latest sample done with 
Gibbs. More sophisticated testing, described later 
first estimates the model parameters over a number of Gibbs 
iterations, and then perform testing using the estimates. 
This is described in later subsections. 
.PP
First run basic LDA with training and parameter fitting on a subset 
and testing on the final 100 documents. 
The training subset is the full dataset minus the test data. 
Logging now to c1.log\&.
Checkpoint every 20 cycles 
(note, we usually only do this for cycles taking over 10 minutes each). 
.Vb
hca \-v \-K20 \-C100 \-c20 \-T100 data/ch c1
.Ve
Again run multi\-core with \fB\-q\fP\fI8\fP
if needed. 
.TP
``\-c20\&'': 
do a checkpoint with any reporting every 
20 cycles. 
.TP
``\-T100\&'': 
use the last 100 documents for testing, 
so the first (datasetsize\-100) are used for training. 
The documents must be ordered so the test data is at the end. 
Alternatively, a file stem can be given if test data is in a 
separate file, so loaded from there. 
.PP
View the end of the log file to get the test perplexity, 
which is printed after ``log_2(test perpML)\&''\&. 
.PP
Now restart but use document completion (every 4th word) to 
get perplexity, with no more Gibbs cycles. 
Without \fB\-h\fP
the default is to use 
a standard likelihood calculation so will be biased. 
.Vb
hca \-v \-e \-r0 \-C0 \-hdoc,4 \-T100 data/ch c1
.Ve
.TP
``\-hdoc,4\&'': 
hold out every 4\-th word in 
the document. 
.TP
``\-T100\&'': 
the test set size must be repeated, since it is not 
reloaded with the restart. 
.PP
View the end of the log file to get the test perplexity, 
which is printed after ``log_2(test perpHold)\&''\&. 
Note it is also recorded in the parameter file. 
.PP
Restart and record the 
PMI and the classification details on test data. 
.Vb
hca \-v \-v \-V \-r0 \-C0 \-Llike,0,0 \-X \-p \-T100 data/ch c1
.Ve
.TP
``\-Llike,0,0\&'': 
prevent it 
doing test likelihood calculations, which are potentially slow 
on larger data sets. 
.TP
``\-X\&'': 
load up class data from data/ch.clas
file to 
enable classification on test data. 
.TP
``\-p\&'': 
initiate PMI calculation. 
.PP
The PMI data has a value printed for each topic as well as a 
final average. It bases its calculations on the matrix 
data/ch.pmi.gz
created explicitly for this test set. 
For other datasets, you will need to download prepared 
PMI matrices from the project homepage. 
The PMI output in the log file 
adds a PMI figure at the end of the second set of 
diagnostics: 
.Vb
Topic 0 stats: p=3.16%, ws=86.3%, ds=71.4%, pmi=2.565,

.SS ESTIMATING MODEL PARAMETERS
.PP
The assumes a run has already been done. 
Now we restart and initiate estimation. 
.Vb
hca \-v \-e \-r0 \-C100 \-lphi,3,1 \-ltheta,3,1 \-lalpha,3,1 data/ch c1
.Ve
.TP
``\-lalpha,3,1\&'': 
estimate the alpha
vector if 
the Alpha side is non\-parametric, and save 
in the c1.alpha
file. 
Estimation starts after the 1st cycle and a sample is added to the 
average every 3 cycles, 
that is, 1,4,7,...,94,97. 
.TP
``\-lphi,3,1\&'': 
estimate the phi
matrix, and if 
the Beta side is non\-parametric, then also estimate the 
beta
vector. 
Saved as the c1.phi
and c1.beta
files respectively. 
Estimation as before. 
.TP
``\-ltheta,3,1\&'': 
estimate the theta
matrix 
and save as the c1.theta
file. 
Estimation as before. 
.PP
The files c1.alpha
and c1.beta
are text but 
the file c1.phi
is binary. 
The file c1.theta
is written in a readable sparse form. 
.PP
.SS BURSTINESS
.PP
The burstiness version significantly improves everything. 
Our best bet, currently, is to run 
with optimisation of the hyperparameters: 
.Vb
hca \-v \-v \-e \-K20 \-C100 \-Sbdk=100 \-Sad=0.5 data/ch c1
.Ve
.TP
``\-Sbdk=100\&'': 
burstiness document concentration is different 
for every topic. This initialises all of them to 100. 
Default has no burstiness. 
.TP
``\-Sad=0.5\&'': 
burstiness document discount set to 
0.5, same for all topics. Default is zero. 
.PP
The initial discount for the bursty topics is 
0.5. The concentration we set quite high initially, 
and these will be sampled separately with 
each topic in batches, so bdk
is a vector in the 
parameter file. 
The hyperparameter sampling slows it down quite a bit but seems to 
make a significant difference. Unused topics sometimes 
get a very low concentration. 
Alternatively, fix the burstiness discount with 
\fB\-F\fP\fIad\fP
and continue sampling burstiness concentration only, 
which is quite a lot faster. 
Note burstiness works well with multi\-core as does 
sampling of hyperparameters. 
.PP
Diagnostics reported for burstiness, printed at the end, are as follows: 
.Vb
Burst report:  multis=55.45%, tables=79.57%, tbls\-in\-multis=63.15%
.Ve
These are: 
.TP
multis: 
percentage of tokens in documents that occur more than 
once. Only these are affected by burstiness processing. 
So (100\-multis)
is proportion of tokens unique in 
their document. 
.TP
tables: 
percentage of data being passed up by the burstiness 
sub\-module to the topic model. 
Note 100% of the (100\-multis)%
unique tokens will 
be passed up as unique tokens always go to the topic model. 
Of the remaining multis%
tokens, only 
tbls\-in\-multis%
get passed up. 
.TP
tbls\-in\-multis: 
the percentage of 
non\-unique words in documents that are passed up by the burstiness 
sub\-module to the topic model. 
.PP
.SS SAMPLE SCRIPTS
.PP
This section lists some useful scripts for doing combined runs. 
Scripts below have common shell parameters: 
.TP
K: 
number of topics 
.TP
T: 
number of documents at end of file to use for testing 
.TP
DATA: 
stem for the data set 
.TP
STEM: 
stem for the result set 
.PP
This first example runs standard HDP\-LDA for 1000 cycles on 4 cores, fitting 
all hyper\-parameters. 
Check points are done every 100 cycles, and at that stage 
a test is done using document completion where every 3/4 words 
are done to train a theta for the test document and the remaining 1/4 
are used to compute perplexity. 
The testing runs 40 Gibbs cycles with a burnin of 10 cycles. 
Basic diagnostics are reported. 
After the 1000 cycles, a restart then runs Gibbs for 
200 cycles and theta, phi and alpha are estimated at that stage. 
Finally, a full diagnostic report is done 
(without holdout testing, though) to report on 
the words in the topics using the estimated phi. 
.Vb
hca \-Bdir \-K$K \-C1000 \-v \-q4 \-c100 \-T$T \-Llike,40,10 \-hdoc,4 $DATA $STEM
hca \-r0 \-v \-C200 \-ltheta,5,1 \-lphi,5,1 \-lalpha,5,1 \-q4 \-T$T $DATA $STEM 
hca \-r0 \-v \-v \-V \-C0 \-ophi \-rphi \-T$T $DATA $STEM
.Ve
Using the holdout testing during checkpointing, we get both 
a training set and a test set perplexity computed for every 
100 cycles of training. 
.PP
This second example tests out burstiness. 
It runs three versions with testing: 
with burstiness using PYP discount (parameter ad)
fixed at 0, 
burstiness using PYP discount (parameter ad)
fixed at 0.5, 
and no burstiness. 
Files are saved in a common directory. 
Note the Stirling number tables are also initialised with 
larger values (60000,3000).

.SH ERRORS

.PP
There is some error reporting on failure. 
.PP
If the software quits during a run on larger data with an 
error message like: 
.Vb
    S_V(N,M,A) tagged 'XXX' hit bounds (BN,BM)
.Ve
for integers N,M
and label XXX
then you 
need to increase the bounds BN,BM\&.
If only the BM
bound is violated, 
then set BN
to its default (10000) and increase 
BM
to, say 5000 (your choice) with the 
option \fB\-N\fP\fI10000,5000\fP\&.
The BN
bound should only be violated 
when the Beta side table is affected, 
in which case the label will be 
XXX=\&''SB, topicXword PYP". 
Now increase BN
to, say 30000 (your choice) with the 
option \fB\-N\fP\fI30000,1000\fP,
leaving BM
as it was. 
.PP
For other errors, please report to the maintainer. 
Best bet is to recompile 
with ``MYDEBUG=\-g\&'' set in the Makefile 
and possibly run under a memory checker to get details of 
the reason for the crash.
