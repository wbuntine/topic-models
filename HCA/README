OVERVIEW
========
HCA is research software that does various versions of non-parametric topic 
models using Gibbs sampling including LDA, HDP-LDA, NP-LDA, all with/without 
burstiness modelling.  Various diagnostics, ``document completion'' testing 
and coherence measurements with PMI are also supported.  The code
runs on multi-core (depending on your compiler) getting about 50% efficiency with 8 cores.

The project home page and more details about the theory behind the software 
can be found in our KDD 2014 paper (Buntine and Mishra):
    http://www.researchgate.net/publication/263162682_Experiments_with_Non-parametric_Topic_Models

A dynamic topic model (tca) is included but still in development.  While
it works well, we haven't properly documented it.

DOCUMENTATION
=============
The documentation is in "doc/".
The man entry and the PDF file are the same.
Examples for running the code are given in the section "Examples".
There is example data files with all the different variant inputs
in the "data/" directory in the main release, that can be downloaded
separately (its largish because it has a lot of different demo files,
even though its a small collection).
Various scripts are provided "as is" with minor documention
in "scripts/" directory.

On the OSX, a Mac
=================
Currently, atomic operations (multi-core) only supported with the
GNU compiler, gcc, and only for a few tested versions.
You install gcc from macports and select ‘gcc as new default compiler’
This can be done by using command 

	#  this is gcc 4.8.2
	sudo port install gcc48
	port select --list gcc

Then edit the top level Makefile to change "-O5" since apparantly gcc on
the OSX doesn't support it the same.

MAKING the PROGRAMME
====================

The only prerequisite is libstb.  Although in Windows you will need to
compile with "gcc", and in OSX "gcc" is best supported.

There is a simple Makefile in this directory currently configured to
optimise the compiler for a Linux machine.  Edit the configuration if
you have a Mac or Windows.

By default, multicore version is disabled.  This is because you should 
get the single core version working and tested first, before
getting the multi-core version.

Then:
	#   this builds the two libraries in "lib/" and "util/" and hca
	make
        #  run a simple test .... (modify executable for windows)
        hca/hca -v -e data/ch /tmp/test
        #  the last line should be a report such as:
        #         log_2(train perp) = 11.06904
        #  (where your value will vary a percent or so)

TESTING
=======
A moderately extensive test script, copying examples from the man page,
is available as "test.sh".   Run it in the current/main directory:
       ./test.sh
so it can find the right files.  While running it directs copious
messages to stderr.     If it encounters an error, it will print 
out a message starting with:
       Cannot run hca/hca  ...
then quit.

BUILD for MULTICORE
==================
For multi-core/threading to work, we need to get atomic operations
supported, which are part of the C++11 standard.

Unfortunately, all recent C compilers seem to vary dramatically in 
their implementation of atomic operations.   We have tested
on Linux boxes only with GNU gcc 4.1.2, 4.4.7, 4.8.0 and 4.8.2.  
But we haven't fully tested 4.1.2.  For GCC versions between these,
some version or the other should work, so probably just need
to modify the conditional.

OSX runs with gcc but we're waiting on the new release of
clang to get that working (we're not OSX experts but expecting
better atomic ops support soon).  Windows works with gcc only.

To get atomic operations working in a different compiler
tool-chain, you will need to edit:
	util/atomic.h   
and you will have to create a new branch of the compiler
conditionals there which test for the compiler version and then provide
conversion macros for yours.  This should not be too
difficult.  You could also send the main author
(details below) your compiler details and he *may* be able to create
a version for you, just not test it.
PLEASE:   Work with us in supporting your compiler tool-chain
          so we can get better coverage ;-)

With the atomic operations working with your compiler, then
edit the top level Makefile.
Add the "-DH_THREADS" switch to the end of compiler options flags
which is MYDEBUG, e.g.
 MYDEBUG=-O5 -DNDEBUG -ffast-math -DHAVE_INLINE -DH_THREADS

Then make as before and test with no extra threads and 4 threads:
        #  run a simple test .... (modify executable for windows)
        hca/hca -v -e data/ch /tmp/test
        hca/hca -v -e -q4 data/ch /tmp/test
You should notice the speed difference.


INSTALLATION
============
Once the softare is made, there are two files to install:
      doc/hca.1    -  the man entry
      doc/tca.1    -  the man entry
      src/hca/hca  -  the executable for non-parametric TMs
      src/hca/tca  -  the executable for non-parametric dynamic TM
The man entry can be read using "man -l doc/hca.1", though
doc/hcaman.pdf is a better rendering of the same source file.

On Linux these can be installed locally at:
	/usr/local/man/man1
	/usr/local/bin
respectively if you manage your own machine or on your home directory at
	$PWD/man/man1
	$PWD/bin
if you have your MANPATH and PATH environment variables set up right.

The documentation in "doc/" and the test data in "data/" should
be used for reference.  The "scripts/" can be handy if you manage
to figure them out!


GETTING STARTED
===============
Work through the examples in the documentation using the data in "data/"


BUGS
====
The current multi-core (threading+atomic) support for tca hasn't been maintained.
It needs to be redesigned.  So don't use it.
Caching for tca (switch PHI_CACHE in "stats.h" has subtle differences to no caching,
so may be wrong).

LICENSES
========
Most of the code is under MPL version 2.0.
The lib/arms.c code comes from Wally Gilk's website without a clear
license.  The lib/digamma.c code comes from Radford Neal's
with a "free" license.
